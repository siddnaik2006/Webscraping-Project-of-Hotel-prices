# Webscraping-Project-of-Hotel-prices
"The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates hotel prices based on features extracted from Booking.com, helping travelers make informed decisions to optimize their vacation budgets by tracking and forecasting accommodation costs."

Explain the Objectives:

Data Collection: Scraping hotel data like hotel names, room types, locations, reviews, and prices.
Price Monitoring: Tracking price fluctuations and storing historical data for analysis.
Customer Feedback Analysis: Collecting and analyzing customer reviews to assess hotel quality.
Methodology
1. Choosing the Website
Mention that you selected Booking.com to scrape hotel data, and you focused on hotels in Mumbai.
2. Inspecting the Website
Explain how you used the Inspect tool in the browser to identify the structure of the HTML elements (like hotel names, prices, reviews) to extract the data.
3. Setting Up the Environment
Libraries Used:
Requests for sending HTTP requests.
BeautifulSoup for parsing the HTML content.
Pandas for storing and manipulating data in a DataFrame.
Highlight how these libraries were key to retrieving and structuring the data.
4. The Scraping Process
Explain your Code:
First, you used requests to send an HTTP GET request to fetch the HTML content of the webpage.
Then, BeautifulSoup was used to parse this HTML content to extract elements like hotel names, locations, descriptions, ratings, reviews, and prices.
Mention how the data was cleaned and structured into lists using loops and Python functions like lambda for cleaner results.
Data Storage:
You created a Pandas DataFrame to store the data and later exported it to a CSV file for further analysis and tracking.
Features Scraped

Hotel Price
5. Code Explanation (Commands)
Walk through how you accessed each piece of data (e.g., using loops to access hotel names, lambda functions to clean location data).
Mention how you structured the data extraction process to deal with real-time data changes and large amounts of data efficiently.
6. Benefits of the Project
Access to Valuable Data: Automates the collection of real-time hotel data, making it easier for travelers to find optimal prices.
Real-Time Insights: Provides insights into price trends and customer satisfaction through continuous data scraping.
Challenges Encountered
Legal Issues: Mention the risk of violating website terms of service and the importance of checking the site's scraping policies.
IP Blocking and Rate Limiting: Websites may block scraping bots or limit how many requests can be made, so you may need to implement strategies to avoid detection (like delays).
Data Accuracy and Integrity: Scraping errors might occur due to changing website structures, which requires constant monitoring and updates.
